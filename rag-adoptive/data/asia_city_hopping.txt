Asia City Hopping
- Choose hubs with strong air links (Tokyo/Seoul/Singapore/Bangkok); combine low-cost carriers with rail for short hops.
- Visas: confirm e-visa/visa-on-arrival rules and passport validity (6+ months).
- Payments: Japan prefers IC cards/cash in smaller shops; Singapore/HK widely accept contactless; carry backup cash.
- SIM/eSIM: buy at airport kiosks or online; verify hotspot allowance for laptops.
- Health: for tropical stops, pack electrolytes, sun protection, and insect repellent; check vaccination advisories.
