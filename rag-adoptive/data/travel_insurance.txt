Travel Insurance Basics
- Coverage to target: trip cancellation/interruption, medical (including emergency evacuation), and lost/delayed baggage.
- Check primary vs secondary medical coverage; ensure pre-existing conditions are covered if needed.
- For adventure activities (diving, trekking, skiing), confirm exclusions and altitude limits.
- Keep policy numbers and insurer contact saved offline; share with a travel partner.
