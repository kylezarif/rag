Travel Guideline: Pre-Trip Planning
- Pick travel dates in shoulder season to reduce cost and crowds.
- Verify passport expiration is at least 6 months out; check visa and entry requirements for each country.
- Build a simple budget: flights, lodging, transit, food, attractions, 10–15% buffer. Pre-book cancellable stays.

Travel Guideline: Packing and Safety
- Pack layers, a compact rain shell, and a small first-aid kit. Keep prescriptions in original containers.
- Carry photocopies of ID and store digital backups. Share your itinerary with a trusted contact.
- Use TSA-friendly locks and keep valuables in a cross-body bag with zipper closures.

Travel Guideline: Local Transit
- Prefer public transit in dense cities; check passes or reloadable cards. Confirm airport transfer options before arrival.
- For driving, review local rules: low-emission zones, toll systems, and right-of-way customs. Keep offline maps downloaded.
- Avoid peak rush hours when possible; leave extra time for intercity trains or ferries.

Travel Guideline: Health and Weather
- Check expected weather ranges and UV index; pack sunscreen and refillable water bottle.
- For high heat, plan outdoor activities early/late; for cold, bring moisture-wicking base layers.
- Confirm any required vaccinations or travel health advisories; buy travel insurance with medical coverage.

Travel Guideline: Etiquette and Safety On-Site
- Learn greetings, tipping norms, and payment preferences (cash vs. cards vs. contactless).
- Stick to well-lit routes at night, and use reputable ride-hailing or licensed taxis.
- Keep emergency numbers handy (local 112/911 equivalents) and know your embassy/consulate contact info.
