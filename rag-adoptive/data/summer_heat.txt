Summer & Heat Management
- Plan outdoor activities at dawn/dusk; book indoor museums midday.
- Hydrate: carry electrolyte packets; avoid excess caffeine/alcohol in peak heat.
- Clothing: light, breathable fabrics; wide-brim hat; UPF layers; reef-safe sunscreen reapplied every 2 hours.
- Lodging: confirm reliable AC or fans; choose shaded rooms or lower floors where possible.
