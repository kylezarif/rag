Global Trip Planning Essentials
- Define purpose: leisure, work, family, or hybrid; set a budget with 15% buffer.
- Timing: prefer shoulder seasons for cost and crowds; check school holidays and local festivals.
- Documents: passports valid 6+ months; visa/ESTA/eTA requirements; digital + printed copies of ID and insurance.
- Money: mix of cards + modest cash; enable travel notices; carry a backup card separate from wallet.
- Safety: share itinerary; enable phone SOS and device tracking; keep embassy/consulate numbers.

Flights & Hubs
- Start with flexible dates + nearby airports; compare train-to-hub options for Europe/Asia.
- Book long-hauls early; keep connections >90 minutes when clearing immigration.
- Overnight flights: pack sleep kit; choose seats away from galleys for rest.

Lodging Strategy
- Prioritize proximity to transit and groceries; for work, confirm desk + Wi-Fi speed tests.
- Families: favor apartments with laundry and kitchenettes; check stroller access.
- Late arrivals: ensure self-check-in details and host contact.

Transit
- Download offline maps; buy local SIM/eSIM with hotspot.
- City transit: check reloadable cards/passes; confirm airport transfers.
- Driving: verify license/IDP needs; learn toll/LEZ zones; keep a paper map for dead zones.

Packing & Health
- Pack layers: base, mid, shell; limit shoes to two pairs; use cubes and weigh bags for strict airlines.
- Health kit: meds in originals, electrolytes, small first-aid; confirm required vaccines.
- Climate: heat—plan dawn/dusk, hydrate, UV protection; cold—insulating mid-layers, gloves, warm hat.

On-Trip Rhythm
- Plan one anchor activity per day; leave margin for rest and weather changes.
- Book time-specific tickets in advance; keep a shared calendar for travel companions.
- Keep receipts, booking codes, and emergency contacts in a shared note.
