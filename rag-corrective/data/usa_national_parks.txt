USA National Parks Planning
- Book peak-season lodging 6-9 months out; target sunrise entries to beat congestion.
- Carry a printed map; offline maps often fail inside canyons and valleys.
- Altitude: acclimate in gateway towns before high trails; hydrate and pace climbs.
- Wildlife: stay 25 yards from bison/elk, 100 yards from bears; pack bear spray where allowed.
- Permits: verify timed entry/parking permits (Glacier, Arches, Yosemite) and wilderness quotas.

Southwest Loop Tips
- Start early for desert hikes; carry 3-4L water per person; avoid exposed trails after noon heat.
- For slot canyons, check flash flood forecasts; never enter with rain nearby.
