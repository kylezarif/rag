Europe Rail Basics
- Book fast trains (TGV/ICE/AVE/Eurostar) in advance for lower fares; regional trains often fixed price.
- Validate paper tickets where required; keep passport handy for cross-border routes.
- Use rail planner apps for platforms/real-time delays; buffer 20-30 minutes for connections with kids or luggage.
- Overnight trains: reserve sleeper/berth; pack eye mask, earplugs, and small padlock for bags.
- Luggage: travel with roll-aboard + small daypack; store larger bags in end-of-car racks and keep valuables with you.
