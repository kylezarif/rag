Family Travel Basics
- Buffer transitions: add 30-60 minutes for airports and train connections with kids.
- Pack a small “calm kit”: snacks, sticker books, headphones, and a backup outfit in the personal item.
- Book lodging with laundry and a kitchenette; prioritize proximity to transit and playgrounds.
- Maintain naps/quiet time; plan one anchor activity per day, with flexible afternoons.
