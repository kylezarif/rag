Renovation Guideline: Planning and Scope
- Define the purpose of the renovation (resale, rental, personal use) and set a realistic budget with a 10-15% contingency.
- Map each room: must-have fixes, nice-to-have upgrades, and items to leave as-is to control scope creep.
- Sequence work cleanly: demo and structural first, utilities second, finishes last. Lock a simple Gantt-style timeline and keep a weekly check-in.

Renovation Guideline: Permits and Safety
- Confirm permit requirements for structural changes, electrical panels, HVAC alterations, egress windows, and load-bearing walls.
- Schedule inspections early and keep permit copies on-site. Photograph wall cavities before closing them.
- Enforce safety: dust control, PPE, fire extinguishers, and locked panels for children and pets.

Renovation Guideline: Structure and Moisture
- Start with water management: grade away from the foundation, clear gutters, and verify sump pumps work.
- Inspect framing for rot or termites; sister or replace compromised studs and joists before adding finishes.
- Use moisture-resistant backer board in wet areas and install continuous vapor barriers where code requires.

Renovation Guideline: Electrical and Mechanical
- Update to modern load needs: dedicated circuits for kitchen appliances, GFCI/AFCI where required, and labeled panels.
- Size HVAC for the updated envelope; seal ducts and consider zoning dampers to balance temperatures.
- In bathrooms and kitchens, pair exhaust fans with timers or humidity sensors to prevent mold.

Renovation Guideline: Finishes and Durability
- Choose durable, cleanable materials in high-traffic areas; avoid porous grout without sealing.
- Prioritize lighting layers: ambient, task, and accent; add dimmers in living spaces.
- For flooring transitions, keep heights level and use reducers where necessary to avoid tripping.

Renovation Guideline: Quality Control
- Build a punch list weekly: alignment, caulk gaps, squeaks, outlet tests, and door swings.
- Keep receipts, paint formulas, and appliance manuals in one binder for handoff.
- After completion, run a full systems check: water pressure, HVAC balance, breaker tests, and GFCI/AFCI trips.
