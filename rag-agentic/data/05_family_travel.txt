Family Travel Basics
- Buffer every transfer by 30-60 minutes; pre-book seats together when possible.
- Pack a “calm kit”: snacks, sticker books, headphones, backup outfit in personal item.
- Lodging: prioritize laundry + kitchenette; proximity to transit and playgrounds.
- Anchors: one key activity/day; schedule naps/quiet time; prefer morning tickets.
- Safety: child ID card in pocket; agree on meetup spot; use hotel business card for taxis.
