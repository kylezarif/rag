Europe Rail & City Hopping
- Book fast trains (TGV/ICE/AVE/Eurostar) early for lower fares; regional trains often fixed price.
- Validate paper tickets where required; keep passport handy for cross-border routes.
- Luggage: roll-aboard + daypack; store big bags in end-of-car racks; keep valuables on you.
- Connections: 20-30 min buffer with kids/bags; use rail apps for platforms and delays.
- Night trains: reserve sleeper/berth; pack eye mask, earplugs, small padlock.

City Transit
- Grab reloadable cards (Oyster/OV-chipkaart/ Navigo) and check daily/weekly caps.
- Airport transfers: pre-check train/metro hours; late arrivals may need taxi/ride-hail.
- Buses/trams: board front/center per city norms; validate tickets.

Cross-Border Tips
- SIM/eSIM: EU roaming often included; confirm fair-use limits.
- Payments: cards broadly accepted; carry some cash for kiosks/smaller towns.
- Etiquette: escalator standing side varies; quiet cars on many long-distance trains.
