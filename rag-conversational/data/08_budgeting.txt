Budgeting & Payments
- Build envelope: flights, lodging, transit, food, activities, 15% buffer.
- Cards: enable travel alerts; carry backup card separate from wallet; check FX fees.
- Cash: withdraw at ATMs in-country; avoid airport exchange kiosks; keep small bills for tips/kiosks.
- Traps: roaming fees—use local SIM/eSIM; luggage fees on LCCs; resort/cleaning fees in rentals.
- Save: cook breakfasts, use city transit passes, travel off-peak, bundle attractions where sensible.
