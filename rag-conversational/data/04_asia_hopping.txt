Asia Hub & Hop Strategy
- Anchor in strong hubs (Tokyo, Seoul, Singapore, Bangkok) then hop via LCCs/rail.
- Visas: verify e-visa/VOA needs; passport validity 6+ months; onward ticket for some entries.
- LCC rules: strict baggage limits; prepay bags; print/soft copies of boarding passes.
- Health: pack electrolytes, sun protection, insect repellent; check vaccine/advisory lists.
- Connectivity: airport SIM/eSIM kiosks are reliable; confirm hotspot allowance.

Local Moves
- Japan: IC cards (Suica/PASMO) for transit; cash still needed at small shops.
- Korea: T-money for metro/bus; taxis plentiful, but note late-night surcharges.
- SE Asia: use ride-hail for safety/pricing; watch for afternoon storms in rainy season.

Weather Windows
- Monsoon: check regional timing (e.g., SW monsoon hits west coast India May-Sep).
- Heat: plan outdoors dawn/dusk; AC availability varies; carry a compact umbrella for sun/rain.
